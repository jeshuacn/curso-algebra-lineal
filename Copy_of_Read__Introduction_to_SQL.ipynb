        "SQL stands for Structured Query Language, which is an ANSI ( American National Standards Institute ) standard language. Relational Database System uses SQL for storing, manipulating, and retrieving data stored in a relational database.\n",
        "\n",
        "SQL is the standard database language for Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS), such as MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and SQL Server. RDMS are using different version like:\n",
        "- MS SQL Server using T-SQL\n",
        "- Oracle using PL/SQL\n",
        "- MS Access version of SQL is called JET SQL\n",

        "## **SQL Process**\n",

        "In RDBMS, the system determines the most efficient path to carry out the SQL command request, and SQL engine finds how to interpret the task.\n",

        "### SQL Parsing\n",
        "The parsing stage involves separating the pieces of a SQL statement into a data structure that other routines can process. When an application issues a SQL statement, the application makes a parse call to the database to prepare the statement for execution. The parse call creates a **cursor**, which is a handle for the session-specific **private SQL area** that holds a parsed SQL statement and other processing information.\n",
        "\n",
        "During parse call, the database performs the following checks:\n",
        "- **Syntax Check**: A statement that breaks a rule for well-formed SQL syntax fails the check.\n",
        "- **Semantic Check**: It determines whether a statement is meaningful or not.\n",
        "- **Shared Pool Check**: It determines whether it can skip resource-intensive steps of statement processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Hard parse: The operation where the database cannot reuse existing code, then it must build a new executable version of the application code.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Soft parse: The process, also called library cache hit, which reuses the existing code when the submitted statement is the same as a reusable SQL statement in the shared pool.\n",
        "\n",
        "### SQL Optimization\n",
        "The database must perform a hard parse at least once for every unique DML statement and performs the optimization during this parse. The **row source generator** is software that receives the optimal execution plan from the optimizer and produces an iterative execution plan that is usable by the rest of the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "The iterative plan is a binary program that, when executed by the SQL engine, produces the result set. The plan takes the form of a combination of steps. Each step returns a row set. The next step either uses the rows in this set, or the last step returns the rows to the application issuing the SQL statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "### SQL Execution\n",
        "\n",
        "The SQL engine executes each row source in the tree produced by the row source generator. This step is the only mandatory step in DML processing. Each step in an execution plan has an ID number. Initial spaces in the Operation column of the plan indicate hierarchical relationships. For example, if two spaces precede the name of an operation, then this operation is a child of an operation preceded by one space. "

The system easily tests them. For instance, you cannot set an integer value to \"user_name\".The data type of domain includes string, character, integer, time, date, currency, etc. The value of the attribute must be available in the corresponding domain.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Data Integrity**\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **Entity Integrity**\n",
        "The entity integrity rule applies to Primary Keys. The entity integrity rule says that the value of a Primary Key in a table must be unique, and it can never have any value (null). Operations on the database which insert new data, update existing data or delete data must follow this rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Referential Integrity Constraints**\n",

        "#### **Key constraints**\n",
